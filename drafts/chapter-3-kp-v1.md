Chapter 3: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – Bold and Hearty (Focus: Peshawar)
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) offers rugged, meat-heavy cuisine influenced by Pashtun tribal traditions and proximity to Afghanistan. Peshawar, the historic gateway city, is famous for its Namak Mandi meat market and open-air kebab houses where smoke rises from massive grills.
Signature dishes: Chapli Kebab (spicy minced beef patties fried flat), Mutton Karahi (wok-cooked goat in tomatoes and green chilies), Kabuli Pulao (rice with carrots, raisins, and meat), Seekh Kebab, Tikka, and Shinwari-style lamb chops.
History and Origin: Rooted in Pashtun nomadic life and Silk Road exchanges with Central Asia and Afghanistan; grilling techniques preserve meat in harsh climates.
Cultural Importance: Food embodies Pashtun hospitality (melmastia)—large platters shared with guests, often during jirgas, weddings, and Eid.
